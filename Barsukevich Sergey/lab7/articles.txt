Filework

C
The corresponding program copies any type of file. Note that files are opened in binary mode, and feof() is used to check for the end of the file

function gets
<cstdio>(stdio.h)
12.02.2011
C
Reads characters from the standard input (stdin) and stores them as a C string into str until a newline character or the end-of-file is reached.
The newline character, if found, is not copied into str.
A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters copied to str.
Notice that gets is quite different from fgets: not only gets uses stdin as source, but it does not include the ending newline character in the resulting string and does not allow to specify a maximum size for str (which can lead to buffer overflows).
